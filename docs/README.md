# API Documentation

## Geolocation Options

The following **Options** can all be provided to the plugin's `#configure` method:

```Javascript
bgGeo.configure({
    desiredAccuracy: 0,
    distanceFilter: 50,
    .
    .
    .
}, function(state) {
    console.log('- Configure success.  Current state: ', state);
});

// Use #setConfig if you need to change options after you've executed #configure

bgGeo.setConfig({
    desiredAccuracy: 10,
    distanceFilter: 10
}, function(state) {
    console.log('- setConfig success.  Current state: ', state);
});

```

| Option | Type | Opt/Required | Default | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`desiredAccuracy`](#param-integer-desiredaccuracy-0-10-100-1000-in-meters) | `Integer` | Required | 0 | Specify the desired-accuracy of the geolocation system with 1 of 4 values, `0`, `10`, `100`, `1000` where `0` means **HIGHEST POWER, HIGHEST ACCURACY** and `1000` means **LOWEST POWER, LOWEST ACCURACY** |
| [`distanceFilter`](#param-integer-distancefilter) | `Integer` | Required | `30`| The minimum distance (measured in meters) a device must move horizontally before an update event is generated. @see Apple docs. However, #distanceFilter is elastically auto-calculated by the plugin: When speed increases, #distanceFilter increases; when speed decreases, so does distanceFilter (disabled with `disableElasticity: true`) |
| [`stopAfterElapsedMinutes`](#param-integer-stopafterelapsedminutes) | `Integer`  |  Optional | `0`  | Stop monitoring location after a set number of minutes have elasped since #start method was called. |
| [`stationaryRadius`](#param-integer-stationaryradius-meters) | `Integer`  |  Required (**iOS**)| `20`  | When stopped, the minimum distance the device must move beyond the stationary location for aggressive background-tracking to engage. Note, since the plugin uses iOS significant-changes API, the plugin cannot detect the exact moment the device moves out of the stationary-radius. In normal conditions, it can take as much as 3 city-blocks to 1/2 km before staionary-region exit is detected. |
| [`disableElasticity`](#param-boolean-disableelasticity-false) | `bool`  |  Optional | `false`  | Set `true` disables automatic speed-based `#distanceFilter` elasticity. eg: When device is moving at highway speeds, locations are returned at ~ 1 / km. |
| [`activityType`](#param-string-activitytype-automotivenavigation-othernavigation-fitness-other) | `String` | Required (**iOS**)| `Other` | Presumably, this affects iOS GPS algorithm. See [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreLocation/Reference/CLLocationManager_Class/CLLocationManager/CLLocationManager.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/CLLocationManager/activityType) for more information | Set the desired interval for active location updates, in milliseconds. |
| [`useSignificantChangesOnly`](#param-boolean-usesignificantchangesonly-false) | `Boolean` | Optional (**iOS**)| `false` | Set `true` in order to disable constant background-tracking and use only the iOS [Significant Changes API](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreLocation/Reference/CLLocationManager_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/CLLocationManager/startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges). If Apple has denied your application due to background-tracking, this can be a solution. **NOTE** The Significant Changes API will report a location only when a significant change from the last location has occurred. Many of the configuration parameters **will be ignored**, such as `#distanceFilter`, `#stationaryRadius`, `#activityType`, etc. |
| [`pausesLocationUpdatesAutomatically`](#param-boolean-pauseslocationupdatesautomatically-true) | `Boolean` | Optional (**iOS**)| `true` | The default behaviour of the plugin is to turn off location-services automatically when the device is detected to be stationary.  When set to `false`, location-services will **never** be turned off (and `disableStopDetection` will automatically be set to `true`) -- it's your responsibility to turn them off when you no longer need to track the device.  This feature should **not** generally be used.  `preventSuspend` will no longer work either.| 
| [`locationAuthorizationRequest`](#param-string-locationauthorizationrequest-always) | `Always`,`WhenInUse` | Optional | `Always` | The desired iOS location-authorization request, either `Always` or `WhenInUse`.  You'll have to edit the corresponding key in your app's `Info.plist`, `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` or `NSWhenInUseUsageDescription`.  `WhenInUse` will display a **blue bar** at top-of-screen informing user that location-services are on.

## Activity Recognition Options

| Option | Type | Opt/Required | Default | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`activityRecognitionInterval`](#param-integer-millis-10000-activityrecognitioninterval) | `Integer` | Required | `10000` | The desired time between activity detections. Larger values will result in fewer activity detections while improving battery life. A value of 0 will result in activity detections at the fastest possible rate. |
| [`stopTimeout`](#param-integer-minutes-stoptimeout) | `Integer` | Required | `5 minutes` | The number of miutes to wait before turning off the GPS after the ActivityRecognition System (ARS) detects the device is `STILL` (**Android:** defaults to 0, no timeout, **iOS:** defaults to 5min). If you don't set a value, the plugin is eager to turn off the GPS ASAP. An example use-case for this configuration is to delay GPS OFF while in a car waiting at a traffic light. |
| [`stopDetectionDelay`](#param-integer-minutes-stopdetectiondelay-0) | `Integer` | Optional | 0 | Allows the stop-detection system to be delayed from activating. When the stop-detection system is engaged, the GPS is off and only the accelerometer is monitored. Stop-detection will only engage if this timer expires. The timer is cancelled if any movement is detected before expiration |
| [`disableMotionActivityUpdates`](#param-boolean-disablemotionactivityupdates-false) | `Boolean` | Optional (**iOS**)| 0 | Disable iOS motion-activity updates (eg: "walking", "in_vehicle").  This feature requires a device having the **M7** co-processor (ie: iPhone 5s and up).  **NOTE** This feature will ask the user for "Health updates".  If you do not wish to ask the user for the "Health updates", set this option to `false`; However, you will no longer recieve activity data in the recorded locations. | 
| [`disableStopDetection`](#param-boolean-disablestopdetection-false) | `Boolean` | Optional (**iOS**)| `false` | Disable iOS accelerometer-based **Stop-detection System**.  When disabled, the plugin will use the default iOS behaviour of automatically turning off location-services when the device has stopped for exactly 15 minutes.  When disabled, you will no longer have control over `stopTimeout`| 

## HTTP / Persistence Options

| Option | Type | Opt/Required | Default | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`url`](#param-string-url-undefined) | `String` | Optional | - | Your server url where you wish to HTTP POST recorded locations to. |
| [`params`](#param-object-params) | `Object` | Optional | `{}` | Optional HTTP params sent along in HTTP request to above `#url`. |
| [`headers`](#param-object-headers) | `Object` | Optional | `{}` | Optional HTTP headers sent along in HTTP request to above `#url` |
| [`extras`](#param-object-extras) | `Object` | Optional | | Optional `{}` to attach to each recorded location |
| [`method`](#param-string-method-post) | `String` | Optional | `POST` | The HTTP method. Some servers require `PUT`.
| [`autoSync`](#param-string-autosync-true) | `Boolean` | Optional | `true` | If you've enabled the HTTP feature by configuring an `#url`, the plugin will attempt to HTTP POST each location to your server **as it is recorded**. If you set `autoSync: false`, it's up to you to **manually** execute the `#sync` method to initate the HTTP POST (**NOTE** The plugin will continue to persist **every** recorded location in the SQLite database until you execute `#sync`). |
| [`batchSync`](#param-string-batchsync-false) | `Boolean` | Optional | `false` | If you've enabled HTTP feature by configuring an `#url`, `batchSync: true` will POST all the locations currently stored in native SQLite datbase to your server in a single HTTP POST request. With `batchSync: false`, an HTTP POST request will be initiated for **each** location in database. |
| [`maxBatchSize`](#param-integer-maxbatchsize-undefined) | `Integer` | Optional | `undefined` | If you've enabled HTTP feature by configuring an `#url` and `batchSync: true`, this parameter will limit the number of records attached to each batch.  If the current number of records exceeds the `maxBatchSize`, multiple HTTP requests will be generated until the location queue is empty. |
| [`maxDaysToPersist`](#param-integer-maxdaystopersist-1) | `Integer` | Optional | `1` | Maximum number of days to store a geolocation in plugin's SQLite database when your server fails to respond with `HTTP 200 OK`. The plugin will continue attempting to sync with your server until `maxDaysToPersist` when it will give up and remove the location from the database. |
| [`maxRecordsToPersist`](#param-integer-maxrecordstopersist--1) | `Integer` | Optional | `-1` |  Maximum number of records to persist in plugin's SQLite database.|

## Application Options

| Option | Type | Opt/Required | Default | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`debug`](#param-boolean-debug-false) | `Boolean` | Optional | `false` | When enabled, the plugin will emit sounds for life-cycle events of background-geolocation! **NOTE iOS**: In addition, you must manually enable the *Audio and Airplay* background mode in *Background Capabilities* to hear these debugging sounds. |
| [`stopOnTerminate`](#param-boolean-stoponterminate-true) | `Boolean` | Optional | `true` | Enable this in order to force a stop() when the application is terminated |
| [`startOnBoot`](#param-boolean-startonboot-false) | `Boolean` | Optional | `true` | Set to `true` to enable background-tracking after the device reboots. |
| [`preventSuspend`](#param-boolean-preventsuspend-false) | `Boolean` | Optional | `false` | Enable this to prevent **iOS** from suspending.  Must be used in conjunction with a `heartbeatInterval`.  **WARNING**: `preventSuspend` should only be used in **very** specific use-cases and should typically **not** be used as it will have a **very serious impact on battery performance.** |
| [`heartbeatInterval`](#param-integer-heartbeatinterval-60) | `Integer(seconds)` | Optional **iOS** | `60` | Used in conjunction with `preventSuspend`, an **iOS** app can continue to monitor the accelerometer while in the **stationary-state**.  If the *slightest* movement is detected during a `hearbeatInterval`, the plugin will request a high-accuracy location in order to determine if the device has begun moving.  If the plugin *is* moving, it will immediately switch state to **moving-state**.|
| [`schedule`](#param-array-schedule-undefined) | `Array` | Optional | `undefined` | Defines a schedule to automatically start/stop tracking at configured times |

## Events

The following events can all be listened-to via the method `#on(eventName, callback)`, eg:
```Javascript
bgGeo.on('location', function(location) {
    console.log('- Location changed: ', location);
});
```

| Event Name | Notes
|---|---|
| [`location`](#location) | Fired whenever a new location is recorded. |
| [`error`](#error) | Fired whenever an error occurs (eg: `location`, `geofence`) |
| [`motionchange`](#motionchange) | Fired when the device changes stationary / moving state. |
| [`geofence`](#geofence) | Fired when a geofence crossing event occurs. |
| [`http`](#http) | Fired after a successful HTTP response. `response` object is provided with `status` and `responseText`. |
| [`heartbeat`](#heartbeat) | Fired each `heartbeatInterval` while the plugin is in the **stationary** state with.  Your callback will be provided with a `params {}` containing the parameters `shakes {Integer}` (#shakes not implemented for Android) as well as the last known `location {Object}` |
| [`schedule`](#schedule) | Fired when a schedule event occurs.  Your `callbackFn` will be provided with the current `state` Object. | 

## Methods

| Method Name | Arguments | Notes
|---|---|---|
| [`configure`](#configureobject-callback) | `{config}` | Configures the plugin's parameters (@see following Config section for accepted config params. The locationCallback will be executed each time a new Geolocation is recorded and provided with the following parameters. |
| [`setConfig`](#setconfigobject) | `{config}` | Re-configure the plugin with new values. |
| [`start`](#startcallbackfn) | `callbackFn`| Enable location tracking. Supplied `callbackFn` will be executed when tracking is successfully engaged. |
| [`stop`](#stop) | `callbackFn` | Disable location tracking. Supplied `callbackFn` will be executed when tracking is successfully engaged. |
| [`startSchedule`](#stopschedulecallbackfn) | `callbackFn` | If a `schedule` was configured, this method will initiate that schedule.  The plugin will automatically be started or stopped according to the configured `schedule`.    Supplied `callbackFn` will be executed once the Scheduler has parsed and initiated your `schedule` |
| [`stopSchedule`](#stopschedulecallbackfn) | `callbackFn` | This method will stop the Scheduler service.  It will also execute the `#stop` method and **cease all tracking**.  Your `callbackFn` will be executed after the Scheduler has stopped |
| [`getState`](#getstatecallbackfn) | `callbackFn` | Fetch the current-state of the plugin, including `enabled`, `isMoving`, as well as all other config params. |
| [`getCurrentPosition`](#getcurrentpositionoptions-successfn-failurefn) | `{options}, `successFn`, `failureFn` | Retrieves the current position. This method instructs the native code to fetch exactly one location using maximum power & accuracy. |
| [`changePace`](#changepaceboolean) | `isMoving` | Initiate or cancel immediate background tracking. When set to true, the plugin will begin aggressively tracking the devices Geolocation, bypassing stationary monitoring. If you were making a "Jogging" application, this would be your [Start Workout] button to immediately begin GPS tracking. Send false to disable aggressive GPS monitoring and return to stationary-monitoring mode. |
| [`getLocations`](#getlocationscallbackfn) | `callbackFn` | Fetch all the locations currently stored in native plugin's SQLite database. Your callbackFn`` will receive an `Array` of locations in the 1st parameter. |
| [`getCount`](#getcountcallbackfn-failurefn) | `callbackFn` | Fetches count of SQLite locations table `SELECT count(*) from locations` |
| [`clearDatabase`](#cleardatabasecallbackfn-failurefn) | `callbackFn` | Delete all records in plugin's SQLite database |
| [`insertLocation`](#insertlocationcallbackfn-failurefn) | `callbackFn` | Manually insert a location into the native plugin's SQLite database.  Your `callbackFn`` will be executed if the operation was successful.  The inserted location's schema must match this plugin's published [Location Data Schema](wiki/Location-Data-Schema).  The plugin will have no problem inserting a location retrieved from the plugin itself. |
| [`sync`](#synccallbackfn) | - | If the plugin is configured for HTTP with an `#url` and `#autoSync: false`, this method will initiate POSTing the locations currently stored in the native SQLite database to your configured `#url`. |
| [`getOdometer`](#getodometercallbackfn) | `callbackFn` | The plugin constantly tracks distance travelled. The supplied callback will be executed and provided with a `distance` as the 1st parameter. |
| [`resetOdometer`](#resetodometercallbackfn) | `callbackFn` | Reset the **odometer** to `0`. The plugin never automatically resets the odometer -- this is **up to you**. |
| [`playSound`](#playsoundsoundid) | `soundId` | Here's a fun one. The plugin can play a number of OS system sounds for each platform. For [IOS](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/AudioServices) and [Android](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/ToneGenerator.html). I offer this API as-is, it's up to you to figure out how this works. |
| [`addGeofence`](#addgeofenceobject) | `{config}` | Adds a geofence to be monitored by the native plugin. Monitoring of a geofence is halted after a crossing occurs. |
| [`addGeofences`](#addgeofencesgeofences-callbackfn-failurefn) | `{geofences}` | Adds a list geofences to be monitored by the native plugin. Monitoring of a geofence is halted after a crossing occurs.|
| [`removeGeofence`](#removegeofenceidentifier) | `identifier` | Removes a geofence identified by the provided `identifier`. |
| [`removeGeofences`](#removegeofences-callbackfn-failurefn) |  | Removes all geofences |
| [`getGeofences`](#getgeofencescallbackfn) | `callbackFn` | Fetch the list of monitored geofences. Your callbackFn will be provided with an Array of geofences. If there are no geofences being monitored, you'll receive an empty `Array []`.|
| [`getLog`](#getlogcallbackfn) | `calbackFn` | Fetch the entire contents of the current circular log and return it as a String.|
| [`emailLog`](#emaillogemail-callbackfn) | `email`, `callbackFn` | Fetch the entire contents of the current circular log and email it to a recipient using the device's native email client.|
| [`beginBackgroundTask`](#beginBackgroundTaskcallbackfn) | `callbackFn`| Begins a native background-task (180s maximum allowed time).  For long-running methods which may execute asynchronous XHR requests, such as #sync or #getLocations, you should wrap your method-calls in a backgroundTask so that iOS does not suspend the app before your async request is complete. |
| [`finish`](#finishtaskId) | `taskId`| Signal completion of a background-task initiated from #beginBackgroundTask.  It's **crucial** that you finish background-tasks because iOS will kill your app if you exceed the 180s limit.|


# Geolocation Options

####`@param {Integer} desiredAccuracy [0, 10, 100, 1000] in meters`

Specify the desired-accuracy of the geolocation system with 1 of 4 values, `0, 10, 100, 1000` where `0` means HIGHEST POWER, HIGHEST ACCURACY and `1000` means LOWEST POWER, LOWEST ACCURACY

- [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreLocation/Reference/CLLocationManager_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/CLLocationManager/desiredAccuracy)

####`@param {Integer} distanceFilter`

The minimum distance (measured in meters) a device must move horizontally before an update event is generated. @see [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreLocation/Reference/CLLocationManager_Class/CLLocationManager/CLLocationManager.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/CLLocationManager/distanceFilter). However, #distanceFilter is elastically auto-calculated by the plugin:  When speed increases, #distanceFilter increases;  when speed decreases, so does distanceFilter.

distanceFilter is calculated as the square of speed-rounded-to-nearest-5 and adding configured #distanceFilter.

  `(round(speed, 5))^2 + distanceFilter`

For example, at biking speed of 7.7 m/s with a configured distanceFilter of 30m:

  `=> round(7.7, 5)^2 + 30`
  `=> (10)^2 + 30`
  `=> 100 + 30`
  `=> 130`

A gps location will be recorded each time the device moves 130m.

At highway speed of 30 m/s with distanceFilter: 30,

  `=> round(30, 5)^2 + 30`
  `=> (30)^2 + 30`
  `=> 900 + 30`
  `=> 930`

A gps location will be recorded every 930m

Note the following real example of background-geolocation on highway 101 towards San Francisco as the driver slows down as he runs into slower traffic (geolocations become compressed as distanceFilter decreases).

![distanceFilter at highway speed](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2319755/cordova-background-geolocaiton/distance-filter-highway.png)

Compare now background-geolocation in the scope of a city. In this image, the left-hand track is from a cab-ride, while the right-hand track is walking speed.

![distanceFilter at city scale](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2319755/cordova-background-geolocaiton/distance-filter-city.png)

####`@param {Integer} stopAfterElapsedMinutes`

The plugin can optionally auto-stop monitoring location when some number of minutes elapse after being the #start method was called.

####`@param {Integer} stationaryRadius (meters)`

When stopped, the minimum distance the device must move beyond the stationary location for aggressive background-tracking to engage. Note, since the plugin uses iOS significant-changes API, the plugin cannot detect the exact moment the device moves out of the stationary-radius. In normal conditions, it can take as much as 3 city-blocks to 1/2 km before staionary-region exit is detected.

####`@param {Boolean} disableElasticity [false]`

Defaults to `false`. Set `true` to disable automatic speed-based `#distanceFilter` elasticity. eg: When device is moving at highway speeds, locations are returned at ~ 1 / km.

####`@param {String} activityType [AutomotiveNavigation, OtherNavigation, Fitness, Other]`

Presumably, this affects ios GPS algorithm. See [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreLocation/Reference/CLLocationManager_Class/CLLocationManager/CLLocationManager.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/CLLocationManager/activityType) for more information

####`@param {Boolean} useSignificantChangesOnly [false]`

Defaults to `false`. Set `true` in order to disable constant background-tracking and use only the iOS [Significant Changes API](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreLocation/Reference/CLLocationManager_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/CLLocationManager/startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges). If Apple has denied your application due to background-tracking, this can be a solution. **NOTE** The Significant Changes API will report a location only when a significant change from the last location has occurred. Many of the configuration parameters **will be ignored**, such as `#distanceFilter`, `#stationaryRadius`, `#activityType`, etc.

Set `true` to disable iOS `CMMotionActivity` updates (eg: walking, running, vehicle, biking, stationary)

# Activity Recognition Options

####`@param {Integer millis} [10000] activityRecognitionInterval`

Defaults to `10000` (10 seconds). The desired time between activity detections. Larger values will result in fewer activity detections while improving battery life. A value of 0 will result in activity detections at the fastest possible rate.

####`@param {Integer millis} minimumActivityRecognitionConfidence`

Each activity-recognition-result returned by the API is tagged with a "confidence" level expressed as a %. You can set your desired confidence to trigger a state-change. Defaults to `80`.

####`@param {Integer minutes} stopTimeout`

The number of miutes to wait before turning off the GPS after the ActivityRecognition System (ARS) detects the device is `STILL` (**iOS:** defaults to 5min). If you don't set a value, the plugin is eager to turn off the GPS ASAP. An example use-case for this configuration is to delay GPS OFF while in a car waiting at a traffic light. **iOS Stop-detection timing**
![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2319755/cordova-background-geolocaiton/ios-stop-detection-timing.png)

####`@param {Integer minutes} stopDetectionDelay [0]`

Allows the stop-detection system to be delayed from activating. When the stop-detection system is engaged, the GPS is off and only the accelerometer is monitored. Stop-detection will only engage if this timer expires. The timer is cancelled if any movement is detected before expiration. If a value of `0` is specified, the stop-detection system will engage as soon as the device is detected to be stationary.

####`@param {Boolan} disableMotionActivityUpdates [false]`

Set `true` to isable iOS `CMMotionActivity` updates (eg: "walking", "in_vehicle").  This feature requires a device having the **M7** co-processor (ie: iPhone 5s and up).  **NOTE** This feature will ask the user for "Health updates".  If you do not wish to ask the user for the "Health updates", set this option to `false`; However, you will no longer recieve activity data in the recorded locations.

####`@param {Boolean} disableStopDetection [false]`

Disable iOS accelerometer-based **Stop-detection System**.  When disabled, the plugin will use the default iOS behaviour of automatically turning off location-services when the device has stopped for exactly 15 minutes.  When disabled, you will no longer have control over `stopTimeout`.

####`@param {Boolean} pausesLocationUpdatesAutomatically [true]`

The default behaviour of the plugin is to turn **off** location-services *automatically* when the device is detected to be stationary.  When set to `false`, location-services will **never** be turned off (and `disableStopDetection` will automatically be set to `true`) -- it's your responsibility to turn them off when you no longer need to track the device.  This feature should **not** generally be used.  `preventSuspend` will no longer work either.

####`@param {String} locationAuthorizationRequest [Always]`

The desired iOS location-authorization request, either `Always` or `WhenInUse`.  Defaults to `Always`.  You'll have to edit the corresponding key in your app's `Info.plist`, `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` or `NSWhenInUseUsageDescription`.  `WhenInUse` will display a **blue bar** at top-of-screen informing user that location-services are on.

# HTTP / Persistence Options

####`@param {String} url [undefined]`

Your server url where you wish to HTTP POST location data to.

####`@param {String} method [POST]`

The HTTP method to use when creating an HTTP request to your configured `#url`. Defaults to `POST`. Valid values are `POST`, `PUT` and `OPTIONS`.

####`@param {String} batchSync [false]`

Default is `false`. If you've enabled HTTP feature by configuring an `#url`, `batchSync: true` will POST all the locations currently stored in native SQLite datbase to your server in a single HTTP POST request. With `batchSync: false`, an HTTP POST request will be initiated for **each** location in database.

####`@param {Integer} maxBatchSize [undefined]`

If you've enabled HTTP feature by configuring an `#url` with `batchSync: true`, this parameter will limit the number of records attached to **each** batch request.  If the current number of records exceeds the `maxBatchSize`, multiple HTTP requests will be generated until the location queue is empty.

####`@param {String} autoSync [true]`

Default is `true`. If you've enabeld HTTP feature by configuring an `#url`, the plugin will attempt to HTTP POST each location to your server **as it is recorded**. If you set `autoSync: false`, it's up to you to **manually** execute the `#sync` method to initate the HTTP POST (**NOTE** The plugin will continue to persist **every** recorded location in the SQLite database until you execute `#sync`).

####`@param {Object} params`

Optional HTTP params sent along in HTTP request to above `#url`.

####`@param {Object} headers`

Optional HTTP params sent along in HTTP request to above `#url`.

####`@param {Object} extras`

Optional arbitrary key/value `{}` to attach to each recorded location

Eg: Every recorded location will have the following `extras` appended:
```Javascript
bgGeo.configure(success, fail, {
  .
  .
  .
  extras: {route_id: 1234}
});
```

####`@param {Integer} maxDaysToPersist [1]`

Maximum number of days to store a geolocation in plugin's SQLite database when your server fails to respond with `HTTP 200 OK`. The plugin will continue attempting to sync with your server until `maxDaysToPersist` when it will give up and remove the location from the database.

####`@param {Integer} maxRecordsToPersist [-1]`

Maximum number of records to persist in plugin's SQLite database.  Default `-1` means no limit.

# Application Options

####`@param {Boolean} debug [false]`

When enabled, the plugin will emit sounds for life-cycle events of background-geolocation!  **NOTE iOS**:  In addition, you must manually enable the *Audio and Airplay* background mode in *Background Capabilities* to hear these [debugging sounds](../../../wiki/Debug-Sounds). See the ../../../wiki [Debug Sounds](wiki/Debug-Sounds) for a detailed description of these sounds.

####`@param {Boolean} stopOnTerminate [true]`
Enable this in order to force a stop() when the application terminated (e.g. on iOS, double-tap home button, swipe away the app). On Android, `stopOnTerminate: false` will cause the plugin to operate as a headless background-service (in this case, you should configure an #url in order for the background-service to send the location to your server)

####`@param {Boolean} startOnBoot [false]`

Set to `true` to enable background-tracking after the device reboots.

**iOS** 
iOS cannot immediately engage tracking after a device reboot since it requires either a "significant-change" event or geofence exit before iOS will awaken your app.  One can also use the [background-fetch plugin](https://github.com/christocracy/cordova-plugin-background-fetch) to *at least* awaken your app within 15 min of being rebooted.

####`@param {Boolean} preventSuspend [false]`

Enable this to prevent **iOS** from suspending after location-services have been switch off.  Must be used in conjunction with a `heartbeatInterval`.  **WARNING**: `preventSuspend` should **only** be used in **very** specific use-cases and should typically **not** be used as it will have a **very serious impact on battery performance.**

####`@param {Integer} heartbeatInterval [60]`

Used in conjunction with `preventSuspend`, an **iOS** app can continue to monitor the accelerometer while in the **stationary-state** (ie: after location-services have been turned off).  If the *slightest* movement is detected during a `hearbeatInterval`, the plugin will request a high-accuracy location in order to determine if the device has begun moving.  If the device *is* moving, it will immediately switch state to **moving-state**.

####`@param {Array} schedule [undefined]`

Provides an automated schedule for the plugin to start/stop tracking at pre-defined times.  The format is cron-like:

```Javascript
  "{DAY(s)} {START_TIME}-{END_TIME}"
```

The `DAY` param *should* respect your current Locale (eg: Sunday: 1; Saturday: 7).  You may configure a single day (eg: `1`), a comma-separated list-of-days (eg: `2,4,6`) or a range (eg: `2-6`).

Eg:
```Javascript
bgGeo.configure({
  .
  .
  .
  schedule: [
    '1 17:30-21:00',   // Sunday: 5:30-9:00
    '2-6 9:00-17:00',  // Mon-Fri: 9am to 5pm
    '2,4,6 20:00-12:00',// Mon, Web, Fri: 8pm to midnight (next day)
    '7 10:00-19:00'    // Sun: 10am-7pm
  ]
}, function(state) {
    // Start the Scheduler
    bgGeo.startSchedule(function() {
        console.info('- Scheduler started');
    });
});

// Listen to "schedule" events:
bgGeo.on('schedule', function(state) {
  console.log('- Schedule event, enabled:', state.enabled);
  
  if (state.enabled) {
    // tracking started!
  } else {
    // tracking stopped
  }
});

// Later when you want to stop the Scheduler (eg: user logout)
bgGeo.stopSchedule(function() {
  console.info('- Scheduler stopped');
});

// Or modify the schedule with usual #setConfig method
bgGeo.setConfig({
  schedule: [
    '1-7 9:00-10:00',
    '1-7 11:00-12:00',
    '1-7 13:00-14:00',
    '1-7 15:00-16:00',
    '1-7 17:00-18:00',
    '2,4,6 19:00-22:00'
  ]
});
```

# Events

The following events can all be listened-to via the method `#on(eventName, callback)`, supplying `location`, `motionchange`, `error`, `geofence` or `http` for `eventName`.

####`location`
Your `callbackFn` will be executed each time the plugin records a new location. The `callbackFn` will be provided with the following parameters:

######@param {Object} location (see Wiki [Location Data Schema](../../..//wiki/Location-Data-Schema))

```Javascript
bgGeo.on('location', (function(location) {
    var coords = location.coords;

    console.log("- Location: " + JSON.stringify(location));
});

```

####`error`
Your `callbackFn` will be executed each time an error occurs. The `callbackFn` will be provided a single `{Object}` parameter containing the following properties:

######@param {String} type ["location" | "geofence"] The type of error
######@param {Number} code See Wiki [Error Codes](../../../wiki/Error-Codes) for details.

eg:
```Javascript
bgGeo.on('error', function(error) {
  var type = error.type;
  var code = error.code;
  alert(type + " Error: " + code);
});

// or using alternate syntax:

bgGeo.on("error", function(error) {
    alert(error.type + " error: " + error.code);
});

```

####`motionchange`
Your `callbackFn` will be executed each time the device has changed-state between **MOVING** or **STATIONARY**. The `callbackFn` will be provided with a `Location` object as the 1st param, with the usual params (`latitude, longitude, accuracy, speed, bearing, altitude`).

######@param {Boolean} isMoving `false` if entered **STATIONARY** mode; `true` if entered **MOVING** mode.
######@param {Object} location The location at the state-change.

```Javascript
bgGeo.on('motionchange', function(isMoving, location) {
    if (isMoving) {
        console.log('Device has just started MOVING', location);
    } else {
        console.log('Device has just STOPPED', location);
    }
})

```

####`geofence`
Adds a geofence event-listener. Your supplied callback will be called when any monitored geofence crossing occurs. The `callbackFn` will be provided the following parameters:

######@param {Object} params. This object contains 2 keys: `@param {String} identifier`, `@param {String} action [ENTER|EXIT]` and `@param {Object} location`.

```Javascript
bgGeo.on('geofence', function(params) {
    try {
        var location = params.location;
        var identifier = params.identifier;
        var action = params.action;

        console.log('A geofence has been crossed: ', identifier);
        console.log('ENTER or EXIT?: ', action);
        console.log('location: ', JSON.stringify(location));
    } catch(e) {
        console.error('An error occurred in my application code', e);
    }
});
```

####`http`

The `callbackFn` will be executed for each HTTP request. The `callbackFn` will be provided a single `response {Object}` parameter with the following properties:

######@param {Integer} status. The HTTP status
######@param {String} responseText The HTTP response as text.

Example:
```Javascript
bgGeo.on('http', function(response) {
    var status = response.status;
    var responseText = response.responseText;
    var res = JSON.parse(responseText);  // <-- if your server returns JSON

    console.log("- HTTP success", status, res);

})
```

####`heartbeat`

The `callbackFn` will be executed for each `heartbeatInterval` while the device is in **stationary** state (**iOS** requires `{preventSuspend: true}` as well).  The `successFn` will be provided a single `params {Object}` parameter with the following properties:

######@param {Integer} shakes (iOS only).  A measure of the device movement.  Shakes is a measure of accelerometer data crossing over a threshold where the device is decided to be moving.  The higher the shakes, the more the device is moving.  When shakes is **0**, the device is completely still.
######@param {Object} location.  When the plugin detects `shakes > 0` (iOS only), it will always request a new high-accuracy location in order to determine if the device has moved beyond `stationaryRadius` and if the location has `speed > 0`.  This fresh location will be provided to your `successFn`.  If `shakes == 0`, the current **stationary location** will be provided.  Android will simply return the "last known location"

Example:
```Javascript
bgGeo.on('heartbeat', function(params) {
    console.log('- hearbeat');

    var shakes = params.shakes;
    var location = params.location;

    // Attach some arbitrary data to the location extras.
    location.extras = {
        foo: 'bar',
        shakes: shakes
    };

    // You can manually insert a location if you wish.
    bgGeo.insertLocation(location, function() {
        console.log('- inserted location during heartbeat');
    });

    // OR you could request a new location:
    bgGeo.getCurrentPosition(function(location, taskId) {
        console.log('- current location: ', location);
        bgGeo.finish(taskId);
    });
})
```

####`schedule`

The `callbackFn` will be executed for each time a `schedule` event occurs.  Your `callbackFn` will be provided with the current `state` object (@see [#getState](#getstatecallbackfn)).  `state.enabled` will reflect the state according to your configured `schedule`.

######@param {Object} State

Example:
```Javascript
bgGeo.on('schedule', function(state) {
    console.log('- A schedule event fired: ', state.enabled);
    console.log('- Current state: ', state);
})
```

# Methods

####`configure({Object}, callback)`

Configures the plugin's initial parameters. You must call this method **before** using the plugin and call it **only once**.  The `callback` will be called after the configuration has been applied and provided with the current `state` object.  **NOTE** The plugin persists its `enabled` state between app restarts/device reboots and will automatically call `#start` upon itself once `#configure` is executed.  You can check the current state in the `callback` with `state.enabled`.

```Javascript
bgGeo.configure({
    distanceFilter: 50,
    desiredAccuracy: 0,
    stationaryRadius: 25
}, function(state) {
    console.log('- Configure success.  Current state: ', state);
});
```

####`setConfig({Object})`
Reconfigure plugin's configuration.

```Javascript
bgGeo.setConfig({
    desiredAccuracy: 10,
    distanceFilter: 100
}, function(state) {
    console.log('- setConfig success.  Current state: ', state);
});
```

####`start(callbackFn)`

Enable background geolocation tracking. `callbackFn` will be executed after plugin has been started.

```Javascript
bgGeo.start(function() {
  alert('Background Geolocation has started');
});
```

####`stop`

Disable background geolocation tracking.

```Javascript
bgGeo.stop();
```

####`startSchedule(callbackFn)`

If a `schedule` was configured, this method will initiate that schedule.  The plugin will automatically be started or stopped according to the configured `schedule`.  

```Javascript
bgGeo.startSchedule(function() {
    console.log('- Scheduler started');
});
```

####`stopSchedule(callbackFn)`

This method will stop the Scheduler service.  It will also execute the `#stop` method and **cease all tracking**.

```Javascript
bgGeo.stopSchedule(function() {
    console.log('- Scheduler stopped');
});
```

####`getState(callbackFn)`

Fetch the current-state of the plugin, including all configuration parameters.

```Javascript
bgGeo.getState(function(state) {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(state));
});

{
  "stopOnTerminate": true,
  "disableMotionActivityUpdates": false,
  "params": {
    "device": {
      "manufacturer": "Apple",
       "available": true,
       "platform": "iOS",
       "cordova": "3.9.1",
       "uuid": "61CA53C7-BC4B-44D3-991B-E9021AE7F8EE",
       "model": "iPhone8,1",
       "version": "9.0.2"
    }
  },
  "url": "http://192.168.11.120:8080/locations",
  "desiredAccuracy": 0,
  "stopDetectionDelay": 0,
  "activityRecognitionInterval": 10000,
  "distanceFilter": 50,
  "activityType": 2,
  "useSignificantChangesOnly": false,
  "autoSync": false,
  "isMoving": false,
  "maxDaysToPersist": 1,
  "stopTimeout": 2,
  "enabled": false,
  "debug": true,
  "batchSync": false,
  "headers": {},
  "disableElasticity": false,
  "stationaryRadius": 20
}
```

####`getCurrentPosition({options}, successFn, failureFn)`
Retrieves the current position. This method instructs the native code to fetch exactly one location using maximum power & accuracy. The native code will persist the fetched location to its SQLite database just as any other location in addition to POSTing to your configured `#url` (if you've enabled the HTTP features). In addition to your supplied `callbackFn`, the plugin will also execute the `callback` provided to `#configure`.

If an error occurs while fetching the location, the `failureFn` will be executed with an `Integer` [Error Code](../../../wiki/Location-Error-Codes) as the first argument.

#### Options

######@param {Integer} timeout [30]
An optional location-timeout. If the timeout expires before a location is retrieved, the `failureFn` will be executed.

######@param {Integer millis} maximumAge [0]
Accept the last-recorded-location if no older than supplied value in milliseconds.

######@param {Integer} minimumAccuracy
Attempt to fetch a location with the supplied minimum accuracy

######@param {Object} extras
Optional extra-data to attach to the location. These `extras {Object}` will be merged to the recorded `location` and persisted / POSTed to your server (if you've configured the HTTP Layer).

######@param {Boolean} persist
Set `false` to disable persisting the retrieve location (default is `true`);

#### Callback

######@param {Object} location The Location data

```Javascript
bgGeo.getCurrentPosition({
  persist: true,
  timeout: 30, // 30 second timeout to fetch location
  maximumAge: 5000, // Accept the last-known-location if not older than 5000 ms.
  minimumAccuracy: 10,  // Fetch a location with a minimum accuracy of `10` meters.
  extras: {       // [Optional] Attach your own custom `metaData` to this location. This metaData will be persisted to SQLite and POSTed to your server
    foo: "bar"
  }
}, function(location) {
    // This location is already persisted to plugin’s SQLite db.
    // If you’ve configured #autoSync: true, the HTTP POST has already started.
    console.log(“- Current position received: “, location);
}, function(errorCode) {
    alert('An location error occurred: ' + errorCode);
});

```

If a location failed to be retrieved, you `failureFn` will be executed with an error-code parameter

| Error | Reason | Code |
|---|---|---|
| kCLErrorLocationUnknown | Could not fetch location | 0 |
| kCLErrorDenied | The user disabled location-services in Settings | 1 |
| kCLErrorNetwork | Network error | 2 |
| kCLErrorHeadingFailure | - | 3 |
| kCLErrorRegionMonitoringDenied | User disabled region-monitoring in Settings | 4 |
| kCLErrorRegionMonitoringFailure | Installed in a device with no region-monitoring capability | 5 |
| kCLErrorRegionMonitoringSetupDelayed | - | 6 |
| kCLErrorRegionMonitoringResponseDelayed | - | 7 |
| kCLErrorDeferredFailed | - | 11 |
| kCLErrorDeferredNotUpdatingLocation | - | 12 |
| kCLErrorDeferredAccuracyTooLow | - | 13 |
| kCLErrorDeferredDistanceFiltered | - | 14 |
| kCLErrorDeferredCanceled | - | 15 |


####`changePace({Boolean})`
Initiate or cancel immediate background tracking. When set to `true`, the plugin will begin aggressively tracking the devices Geolocation, bypassing stationary monitoring. If you were making a "Jogging" application, this would be your [Start Workout] button to immediately begin GPS tracking. Send `false` to disable aggressive GPS monitoring and return to stationary-monitoring mode.

```Javascript
bgGeo.changePace(true);  // <-- Aggressive GPS monitoring immediately engaged.
bgGeo.changePace(false); // <-- Disable aggressive GPS monitoring. Engages stationary-mode.
```

####`addGeofence({Object})`
Adds a geofence to be monitored by the native plugin. Monitoring of a geofence is halted after a crossing occurs. The `config` object accepts the following params.

######@config {String} identifier The name of your geofence, eg: "Home", "Office"
######@config {Float} radius The radius (meters) of the geofence. In practice, you should make this >= 100 meters.
######@config {Float} latitude Latitude of the center-point of the circular geofence.
######@config {Float} longitude Longitude of the center-point of the circular geofence.
######@config {Boolean} notifyOnExit Whether to listen to EXIT events
######@config {Boolean} notifyOnEntry Whether to listen to ENTER events

```Javascript
bgGeo.addGeofence({
    identifier: "Home",
    radius: 150,
    latitude: 45.51921926,
    longitude: -73.61678581,
    notifyOnEntry: true,
    notifyOnExit: false
});
```

####`addGeofences(geofences, callbackFn, failureFn)`
Adds a list of geofences to be monitored by the native plugin.  Monitoring of a geofence is halted after a crossing occurs.  The `geofences` param is an `Array` of geofence Objects `{}` with the following params:

######@config {String} identifier The name of your geofence, eg: "Home", "Office"
######@config {Float} radius The radius (meters) of the geofence.  In practice, you should make this >= 100 meters.
######@config {Float} latitude Latitude of the center-point of the circular geofence.
######@config {Float} longitude Longitude of the center-point of the circular geofence.
######@config {Boolean} notifyOnExit Whether to listen to EXIT events
######@config {Boolean} notifyOnEntry Whether to listen to ENTER events
######@config {Boolean} notifyOnDwell (Android only) Whether to listen to DWELL events
######@config {Integer milliseconds} loiteringDelay (Android only) When `notifyOnDwell` is `true`, the delay before DWELL event is fired after entering a geofence.

```Javascript
bgGeo.addGeofences([{
    identifier: "Home",
    radius: 150,
    latitude: 45.51921926,
    longitude: -73.61678581,
    notifyOnEntry: true,
    notifyOnExit: false,
    notifyOnDwell: true,
    loiteringDelay: 30000   // <-- 30 seconds
}], function() {
    console.log("Successfully added geofence");
}, function(error) {
    console.warn("Failed to add geofence", error);
});
```

####`removeGeofence(identifier)`
Removes a geofence having the given `{String} identifier`.

######@config {String} identifier The name of your geofence, eg: "Home", "Office"
######@config {Function} callbackFn successfully removed geofence.
######@config {Function} failureFn failed to remove geofence

```Javascript
bgGeo.removeGeofence("Home");
```

####`removeGeofences(callbackFn, failureFn)`
Removes all geofences.

######@config {Function} callbackFn successfully removed geofences.
######@config {Function} failureFn failed to remove geofences

```Javascript
bgGeo.removeGeofences(function() {
    console.log("Successfully removed alll geofences");
}, function(error) {
    console.warn("Failed to remove geofence", error);
});
```

####`getGeofences(callbackFn)`

Fetch the list of monitored geofences. Your `callbackFn` will be provided with an `Array` of geofences. If there are no geofences being monitored, you'll receive an empty Array `[]`.

```Javascript
bgGeo.getGeofences(function(geofences) {
    for (var n=0,len=geofences.length;n<len;n++) {
        console.log("Geofence: ", geofence.identifier, geofence.radius, geofence.latitude, geofence.longitude);
    }
});
```

####`getLocations(callbackFn)`
Fetch all the locations currently stored in native plugin's SQLite database. Your `callbackFn`` will receive an `Array` of locations in the 1st parameter. Eg:

The `callbackFn` will be executed with following params:

######@param {Array} locations. The list of locations stored in SQLite database.


```Javascript
    bgGeo.getLocations(function(locations) {
        try {
            console.log("locations: ", locations);
        } catch(e) {
            console.error("An error occurred in my application code");
        }
    });
```


####`getCount(callbackFn, failureFn)`
Fetches count of SQLite locations table `SELECT count(*) from locations`.  The `callbackFn` will be executed with count as the only parameter.

######@param {Integer} count

```Javascript
    bgGeo.getCount(function(count) {
        console.log('- count: ', count);
    });
```

####`insertLocation(params, callbackFn, failureFn)`
Manually insert a location into the native plugin's SQLite database.  Your `callbackFn` will be executed if the operation was successful.  The inserted location's schema must match this plugin's published [Location Data Schema](wiki/Location-Data-Schema).  The plugin will have no problem inserting a location retrieved from the plugin itself.

######@param {Object} params.  The location params/object matching the [Location Data Schema](wiki/Location-Data-Schema).

```Javascript
    bgGeo.insertLocation({
    "uuid": "f8424926-ff3e-46f3-bd48-2ec788c9e761", // <-- required
    "coords": {                   // <-- required
      "latitude": 45.5192746,
      "longitude": -73.616909,
      "accuracy": 22.531999588012695,
      "speed": 0,
      "heading": 0,
      "altitude": 0
    },
    "timestamp": "2016-02-10T22:25:54.905Z"     // <-- required
    }, function() {
        console.log('- Inserted location success');
    }, function(error) {
      console.warn('- Failed to insert location: ', error);
    });

    // insertLocation can easily consume any location which it returned.  Note that #getCurrentPosition ALWAYS persists so this example
    // will manually persist a 2nd version of the same location.  The purpose here is to show that the plugin can consume any location object which it generated.
    bgGeo.getCurrentPosition(function(location, taskId) {
      location.extras = {foo: 'bar'}; // <-- add some arbitrary extras-data

      // Insert it.
      bgGeo.insertLocation(location, function() {
        bgGeo.finish(taskId);
      });
    });
```

####`clearDatabase(callbackFn, failureFn)`
Remove all records in plugin's SQLite database.

```Javascript
    bgGeo.clearDatabase(function() {
      console.log('- cleared database'); 
    });
```

####`sync(callbackFn)`

If the plugin is configured for HTTP with an `#url` and `#autoSync: false`, this method will initiate POSTing the locations currently stored in the native SQLite database to your configured `#url`. All records in the database will be DELETED. If you configured `batchSync: true`, all the locations will be sent to your server in a single HTTP POST request, otherwise the plugin will create execute an HTTP post for **each** location in the database (REST-style). Your `callbackFn` will be executed and provided with an Array of all the locations from the SQLite database. If you configured the plugin for HTTP (by configuring an `#url`, your `callbackFn` will be executed after the HTTP request(s) have completed. If the plugin failed to sync to your server (possibly because of no network connection), the `failureFn` will be called with an `errorMessage`. If you are **not** using the HTTP features, `sync` is the only way to clear the native SQLite datbase. Eg:

Your callback will be provided with the following params

######@param {Array} locations. The list of locations stored in SQLite database.

```Javascript
    bgGeo.sync(function(locations) {
        try {
            // Here are all the locations from the database. The database is now EMPTY.
            console.log('synced locations: ', locations);
        } catch(e) {
            console.error('An error occurred in my application code', e);
        }
    });

```

####`beginBackgroundTask(callbackFn)`

Begins a native background-task (180s maximum allowed time).  For long-running methods which may execute asynchronous XHR requests, such as #sync or #getLocations, you should wrap your method-calls in a backgroundTask so that iOS does not suspend the app before your async request is complete.  iOS will prevent suspending the app until you `#finish` the task.

```Javascript
  bgGeo.beginBackgroundTask(function(taskId) {

    bgGeo.getLocations(function(locations) {
      // Perform an Async XHR requests.
      $.post({
        url: 'http://your.server.com/locations',
        method: 'POST',
        success: function(response) {
          bgGeo.finish(taskId); // <-- Signal to iOS that your background-task is complete.
        }
      });
    });
  });
```

####`finish(taskId)`

Signal completion of a background-task initiated by #beginBackgroundTask.  It's **crucial** that you finish background-tasks because iOS will kill your app if you exceed the 180s limit.

```Javascript
  bgGeo.beginBackgroundTask(function(taskId) {
    bgGeo.finish(taskId);
  });
```

####`getOdometer(callbackFn)`

The plugin constantly tracks distance travelled. To fetch the current **odometer** reading:

```Javascript
    bgGeo.getOdometer(function(distance) {
        console.log("Distance travelled: ", distance);
    });
```

####`resetOdometer(callbackFn)`

Reset the **odometer** to zero. The plugin never automatically resets the odometer so it's up to you to reset it as desired.

####`getLog(callbackFn)`

Fetches the entire contents of the current circular-log and return it as a String.

```Javascript
    bgGeo.getLog(function(log) {
        console.log(log);
    });
```

####`emailLog(email, callbackFn)`

Fetch the entire contents of the current circular log and email it to a recipient using the device's native email client.

```Javascript
    bgGeo.emailLog("foo@bar.com");
```

####`playSound(soundId)`

Here's a fun one. The plugin can play a number of OS system sounds for each platform. For [IOS](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/AudioServices) and [Android](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/ToneGenerator.html). I offer this API as-is, it's up to you to figure out how this works.

```Javascript
    // A soundId iOS recognizes
    bgGeo.playSound(1303);

    // An Android soundId
    bgGeo.playSound(90);
```
